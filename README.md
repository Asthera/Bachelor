Project at [WandB](https://wandb.ai/daswoldemar/bachelor?nw=nwuserdaswoldemar)




## Instructions from the University

1. Create an overview of image data augmentation associated with neural network training with a focus on medical image data.
2. Provide an overview of existing solutions for parallel hyperparameter tuning in neural networks.
3. Use the processed knowledge to design augmentation methods suitable for ultrasound image data.
4. Apply the selected methods and develop a mechanism for automatic and parallel validation of the proposed experiments.
5. Compare the results of the different augmentation techniques and perform an appropriate evaluation.
6. Prepare documentation as directed by the thesis advisor.
