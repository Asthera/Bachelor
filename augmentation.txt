Create a review on the augmentation of image data associated with training neural
networks, focusing on medical image data:
- Introduce the concept of image data augmentation and its necessity in training neural networks.
- Discuss the different types of image data augmentation techniques used in a general context.
- Focus on challenges and considerations when augmenting medical images, such as preserving visual integrity and diagnostic quality of images.
- Figure out which techniques are more suitable for medical image data.



# Analytical Chapter

This chapter analyzes the basis of the thesisâ€™s key points.

First, we explain the idea behind the data augmentation technique and the importance of applying it when training neural networks.

Secondly, it provides an extensive overview of the existing approaches to augment image data.

Next, identify peculiarities that we face by augmenting medical image data.

Finally, we evaluate which image data augmentation techniques are more appropriate for medical image data.



## Data Augmentation

Large amounts of data are necessary for training accurate, reliable neural networks, which is a well-known concept in Machine Learning [Cite AlexNet 2012].
Since it is difficult and sometimes impossible due to the nature of the image to collect as many images as in ImageNet, we are forced to look for solutions with what we have.
This is where the main idea of Data Augmentation comes from expanding the size of training samples by creating modified versions of available data.
Despite having access to a large amount of data, one should pay attention to the importance of augmentation techniques. These methods can manipulate within image data space,
creating alternative variants that account for possible invariances caused by shooting factors such as angle, distance [When To Warp]

## Taxonomy of Data Augmentation in medical image data

In this section, we provide a taxonomy of da

Before we talk about the types themselves, it is necessary to clarify possible inaccuracies in applying augmentation techniques.

As mentioned above, changes can be applied to the data space of an image, but they can also apply to the feature space.
We consider only the first variant, based on [when to warp], which says that if the possible image distortion is known, then it is better to apply it to the data space.
