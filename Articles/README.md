- AlexNet.pdf
  - Default paper about building CNNs
  - Interesting ideas for augmenting data for testing
    -  At test time, the network makes a prediction by extracting five 224 Ã— 224 patches (the four corner patches and the center patch) as well as their horizontal reflections (hence ten patches in all), and averaging the predictions.
  - Augmenting data for training
    -  The training set was augmented by generating image translations and horizontal reflections [AlexNet.py].

- WhenToWarp.pdf
    - Comparing warping in data-space and in feature-space, data-space is better.
    - Methods for data-space used: affine transformations (translation, shearing, rotation) and elastic deformations.


    

- AutoAugment.pdf
  - A new data augmentation technique that uses algorithm based on RL to find the best augmentation policies [AutoAugment.txt].
