- AlexNet.pdf
  - Default paper about building CNNs
  - Interesting ideas for augmenting data for testing
    -  At test time, the network makes a prediction by extracting five 224 Ã— 224 patches (the four corner patches and the center patch) as well as their horizontal reflections (hence ten patches in all), and averaging the predictions.
  - Augmenting data for training
    -  The training set was augmented by generating image translations and horizontal reflections [AlexNet.py].

  
- WhenToWarp.pdf
  - Comparing warping in data-space and in feature-space, data-space is better.
  - Methods for data-space used: 
    - affine transformations (translation, shearing, rotation)
    - elastic deformations.

  
- AutoAugment.pdf
  - A new data augmentation technique that uses algorithm based on RL to find the best augmentation policies [AutoAugment.txt].
  - Uses a search space of 16 operations and 10 magnitudes.
  - Operations: 
    - ShearX/Y, TranslateX/Y, Rotate, AutoContrast, Invert, Equalize, So- larize, Posterize, Contrast, Color, Brightness, Sharpness, Cutout [12], Sample Pairing [24].2
  - Dataset: CIFAR-10, SVHN, ImageNet
  - 5 sub-policies, each with 2 operations

  
- Paired_Augmentation_for_Improved_Image_Classification_using_Neural_Network_Models.pdf
  -  Shear, Vertical Flip like single augmentations
  -  Paired augmentations(Simple + Complex) are better than single augmentations
     - Dataset 1 (Brain Tumor dataset):
       - sample pairing (an advanced  technique applied offline) with shear (a simple  technique applied online.
     - Dataset 2 (White Blood Cell dataset):
       - shear (advanced, offline) with vertical flipping (simple, online).
  - Uses augmentation in online and offline manner:
    - Offline augmentation transforms all images by increasing the size of the dataset before input to the model 
    - Online augmentation transforms the images in a batch-wise manner during model training in a feedforward manner.


- Optimizing CNN based model for thyroid nodule.pdf
  - USG images of thyroid nodules
  - Data augmentation: 
    -  RandRotation, RandomXReflection, RandomYReflection, RandomXTranslation, RandomYTranslation
  - Noise remove:
   - Compared median blur and gaussian blur
     - Gaussian blur is better
  - Used morphological operations for segmentation:
    - Erosion, Dilation
  - The morphological gradient function is performed for the enhancement of the edges
  - Good discussed metrics

- An_Improvement_for_Medical_Image_Analysis_Using_Data_Enhancement_Techniques_in_Deep_Learning.pdf
  - From text:
    - In this work, for any input image we created other new 3 images using horizontal and vertical flip and rotation by 90 degrees (Figure 1))
  - So they used offline manner of augmentation
